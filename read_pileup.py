"In the pileup format (without -u or -g), each line represents a genomic position, 
consisting of chromosome name, 1-based coordinate, reference base, the number of reads covering the site, read bases, base qualities and alignment mapping qualities. 
Information on match, mismatch, indel, strand, mapping quality and start and end of a read are all encoded at the read base column.

At this column, a dot stands for a match to the reference base on the forward strand, a comma for a match on the reverse strand, a '>' or '<' for a reference skip, 
`ACGTN' for a mismatch on the forward strand and `acgtn' for a mismatch on the reverse strand. 
A pattern `\\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' indicates there is an insertion between this reference position and the next reference position. 
The length of the insertion is given by the integer in the pattern, followed by the inserted sequence. 
Similarly, a pattern `-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' represents a deletion from the reference. The deleted bases will be presented as `*' in the following lines. 
Also at the read base column, a symbol `^' marks the start of a read. The ASCII of the character following `^' minus 33 gives the mapping quality. 
A symbol `$' marks the end of a read segment."
